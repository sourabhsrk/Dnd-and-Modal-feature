# Dnd-and-Modal-feature
This was a task given by NetixAI company, it was fun doing it. There are more to this project will add more feature to it in future.


## Important points
- I have implemented Drag and drop feature using React-beautiful-DnD, there are limitation of using this module.
- Limitation such as you can implement drag in unidirectional in one container i.e. horizontal and vertical. For me it has not work for container with flex-wrap property creating multi-rows.
- I have solve the problem using two container but that is only a workaround and its not smooth.
- The RestAPI feature is simple, i can do that but right now i dont have much time. I already spent so much time on solving this drag and drop.
